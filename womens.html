		<h2>Womens Walking Football</h2>
		<p>Giorgio Columbi got in touch with me via Robin of Fleet of Foot. He invited 8 of our women, from fleet of foot, to participate in some friendly games against Portsmouth Womens Walking Football, at their training ground in Portsmouth, Roko/Play Football Community Centre, followed by a Buffet lunch for all in the study area of Portsmouth fratton park. This was then followed by promotion photos on pitch side of Fratton Park and complimentary tickets for all the players to watch Portsmouth play Doncaster.</p>
		<p>The weather at our end was snow and ice, making it impossible for two players to get to Portsmouth. We managed to squeeze 6 players and kit in a 7 seater and negotiated the snowy roads to get onto the clear motorway.</p>
		<p>Giorgio was well organised with everything and looked after us from the minute we arrived to the end of Pompeys match. He got us 2 parking permit tickets, literally, outside the ground and ensured that we reached our seats safely at the ground. Our other car with player number 7 arrived, hasten to say, after the walking football games, due to being snowed in. However, Giorgio guided them by phone to our location and parking and escorted them to the buffet lunch. It was good that they arrived for the promotion photos but disappointing for them not to get to the matches in time, due to the weather.</p>
		<p>On Arrival at 10.58am to start at 11.00am, we were greeted in the car park by a colleague of Giorgio, who led us to the playing 7 a side pitches, where Giorgio and Porstmouth Ladies were ready to go. A quick change of clothing and warm up and we were ready to go! Giorgio refereed all the matches very fairly with rules in place and no running!. We didn’t have time for nerves as we were straight in without thinking about it.</p>
		<p>The first two games were strictly 3 touch only, which proved to be beneficial to us as we practice this on our training nights, and 8 minutes each half. 8 minutes each half was a little exhausting without substitutes but due to our ability and strength we managed to settle, letting the ball do the work and enjoying ourselves. The next two games were as many touches as you like. We won 3 games and drew 1 game scoring 8 goals between us due to excellent shooting and passing from team players. The games were played in good spirit with some fine shooting and saves by both teams. Portsmouth Woman had only been playing together for a short while compared to our 18 months which proved to show our strengths in passing and shooting. We remembered that when we started, we couldn’t put 2 passes together and now we can control, pass and shoot. Lots of progression in all aspects.</p>
		<p>Giorgio has a passion for walking football. He plays in the Portsmouth Mens walking football and there are many trophies in their cabinet to show what a great team they are. He is very keen to promote the womans walking football and he feels that he is beginning to now build up a picture of Women teams who would be happy to come down for a tournament.</p>
		<p>We learnt a lot from this experience and hopefully will go on to better things. The key is to enjoy it and we certainly did but also the privilege of being able to play at an age when most of us thought our playing days were behind us.</p>
		<p>Giorgio emailed us and Pompeys ladies tweeted that evening and thanked us for our perseverance and determination in making it down to Portsmouth braving the snow and terrible weather conditions in Fleet. They said it was such a memorable day out for them too.</p>
		<p>Pompey want return matches to our venue in the future.</p>
