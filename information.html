			<h2>On Field Activities</h2>
			<p>Playing is centred around the above sessions which begin with a warm up followed by (typically) 5 or 6 aside games in 10 minute sections with 2 minutes rest in between. The make up of teams and game duration may vary depending on the numbers in attendance.</p>
			<p>We play in accordance with the rules of the Walking Football Association, modified only by adherence to Hampshire FA's adoption of a 3 touch rule.</p>
			<p>The WFA and our Club promote the playing of walking football as a predominately non contact sport where players can exercise in a competitive but safe environment showing mutual respect.</p>
			<p>Whilst competitive walking football is, and should be, run in age related groups, the weekly club sessions are played on an 'all age' basis and players are expected to give this due consideration during play.</p>
			<p>Whenever suitable, we organise our own tournaments, accept invites to play in other tournaments, and compete in county leagues.</p>
			
			<h2>Cost of Membership</h2>
			<p>Each session carries a £3 attendance fee. After 3 sessions, new members are required to pay a £10 membership fee if they wish to continue. Thereafter, there is a £10 annual renewal.</p>
			<p>The Club has its own bank account and all monies are paid electronically into it.</p>
			<p>Any member is entitled to details of the Club accounting status at any time.</p>

			<h2>Club History and Organisation</h2>
			<p>We first started playing in 2017, coinciding with the opening of Fleet's new leisure centre which offers us modern 3G pitches and a friendly cafe. With membership numbers growing at a steady rate, we were soon able to assume formal club status with a constitution and a steering group to carry the load.</p>
			<p>The Club is affiliated to both the Walking Football Association and to Hampshire FA.</p>
