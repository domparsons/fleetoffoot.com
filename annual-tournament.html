		<h2>Club Championship</h2>
		<p>Fleet Of Foot walking football club members showed a kind Hart when they staged their club championship.</p>
		<p>Sponsored by the Exchequer pub, Crookham Village, and with Hart Leisure Centre providing free pitches, £330  was raised for children’s charity, Piggles Trust.</p>
		<p>Club founder Robin Howard said: “This was the biggest and best tournament we have run so far, so a big thanks to Everyone Active, the Exchequer for prizes and all who played and donated including members of Fleet U3A.”</p>
		<p>Long-standing club member Jim  Hill organised the event and it proved to be a popular attraction for men and women.</p>
		<p>With about 40 players participating, the players were split into five teams, playing seven-side under Walking Football Association rules.</p>
		<p>The Purples came out on top after four matches and Dave Porter had the honour of being named player of the tournament.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile FOF over 60s advanced to the second round of the WFA National Cup after beating Oxford 1-0 at home.  Rob Rowley scored a late winner after being set up by Mark Pirie.</p>
