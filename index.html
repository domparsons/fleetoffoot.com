			<h2>Competitive Walking Football.</h2>
			<p>70+</p>
			<p>The men's section made a return to competition last week, travelling to Bournemouth for the recently started WFA southern 70+ league. 
			Still in its infancy, the league currently comprises Bournemouth, Eastleigh, Cove, Portsmouth and Exeter(!). We were aiming to join later in the year but stepped in to replace Portsmouth who had withdrawn.
			Matches were 7 aside and 20 minutes straight through. With only 7 in our squad (including 2 from Bournemouth) we had to work hard but came away with a creditable set of results losing 1-0 to Bournemouth and Exeter, drawing 0-0 with Cove and beating Eastleigh 2-0. 
			We currently sit NOT bottom of the league, having missed out on the previous event.
			The squad comprised Adrian, Alan, Brian, Graham and myself plus two loanees from the home club.
			Going forward we are in dire need of a goalkeeper (we can use someone 65+ in this comp) so, if you know anyone, please give them a nudge.</p>
			<h2>Youth Section</h2>
			<p>My assessment of the current batch of younger players is that we should be in a position to operate a 60+ (or similar) team. The most likely place to do this is within the Hants FA league run from Southampton. This, however, continues to be run as a 50+ competition despite ourselves and other clubs saying this is dangerous and asking for an older age grouping. Following some ad hoc discussions at Bournemouth, it was decided to renew attempts to get Hants FA to see sense.</p>
			<h2>Steering Group</h2>
			<p>We have some changes here with Martin (membership) and Neil (social) relinquishing their positions. Many thanks to both of them for all the good work they put in. Dave Pomfret has agreed to run the memberships, welcome to him, and we remain searching for someone to take over the social events. All applications gratefully received.</p>
			<h2>Membership</h2>
			<p>We will very soon be in a position to review the composition of the membership so a reminder that, apart from those new members who joined in the last quarter of 2021, you should have remitted your £5 annual renewal. </p>
			<p>Best Regards and Happy Walking Football,</p>
			<p>Robin.</p>

			<p>Having understandably paused our preferential discount dining scheme during covid, the Exchequer has kindly reintroduced it (excluding during December and first week of January). The previously issued cards remain valid. If you can't find yours, get another one from Robin or Sue.</p>
			<p>Pete and Neil recently got married. (Not to each other). Congratulations to them both.</p>

			<p>(The following article by Ken appears in the Fleet News)</p>
			<br>
			<p>"They are two of a kind at Fleet of Foot - and celebrating promotion to a higher level of walking football.</p>
			<p>Step forward Sue Scarlett and Elaine Tookey, who have both been selected for the South East region’s over 50s women’s squad after successful trials.</p>
			<p>The pair’s marvellous achievement is another proud moment for Fleet of Foot  and the supportive staff at Hart Leisure Centre where the club is based.</p>
			<p>The pair’s colleague Adrian Bunting set the benchmark by becoming a member of the first England over 75s squad.</p>
			<p>Adrian, who stepped up to the South Region himself, is not surprised to see Sue and Elaine make it a remarkable treble for Fleet of  Foot.</p>
			<p>He said: “I had always believed that both players had the skill sets to progress beyond domestic club football."</p>
			<p>Elaine is at her best playing wide right or left, has a good first touch and high energy levels.</p>
			<p>Sue prefers to play as a central player, midfield or striker, and possesses a powerful shot with both feet, and is very fit.</p>
			<p>A season of inter-region tournament football with the regular travel that comes with such commitment, will decide whether either or both want to progress to England trials.</p>
			<p>Sue and Elaine are unanimous in stating it is “a dream come true” to be selected.</p>
			<p>Sue, a swimming teacher and cafe assistant at the leisure centre,  said: “ The moment I read the news from the WFA (Walking Football Association) SE England manager I was elated.</p>
			<p>“It is a  very proud moment for me to have been selected. I read the message three times for it to sink in. I realised then what an incredible and privileged opportunity for me to play at this level at my age. A dream come true.”</p>
			<p>Elaine said: "When I went to senior school I was told that I wasn't allowed to play football because I was a girl,</p>
			<p>So nearly 50 years later to be selected to play for the England SE region squad is a dream come true.</p>
			<p>Playing twice a week for Fleet of Foot has been an inspiration. Walking football is a great game to play and I have met some amazing people.”</p>
