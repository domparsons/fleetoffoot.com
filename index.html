			<p>We operate out of the Hart Leisure Centre in Hitches Lane.</p>
			<p>We play exclusively outdoors on 3G surfaces, using either the 5 aside cages or areas of the full size pitch.</p>
			<p>Sessions are every week as follows;</p>
			<p>Tuesday 2pm start. Normally on the main pitch. Mostly men but ladies can play.</p>
			<p>Thursday 2pm start. Usually in one of the cages but can be on the main pitch if numbers warrant. Mostly men but ladies can play.</p>
			<p>Thursday 7-8 pm. In one of the cages. The dedicated Ladies session.</p>

			<h2>On Field Activities</h2>
			<p>Playing is centred around the above sessions which begin with a warm up followed by (typically) 5 or 6 aside games in 10 minute sections with 2 minutes rest in between. The make up of teams and game duration may vary depending on the numbers in attendance.</p>
			<p>We play in accordance with the rules of the Walking Football Association, modified only by adherence to Hampshire FA's adoption of a 3 touch rule.</p>
			<p>The WFA and our Club promote the playing of walking football as a predominately non contact sport where players can exercise in a competitive but safe environment showing mutual respect.</p>
			<p>Whilst competitive walking football is, and should be, run in age related groups, the weekly club sessions are played on an 'all age' basis and players are expected to give this due consideration during play.</p>
			<p>Whenever suitable, we organise our own tournaments, accept invites to play in other tournaments, and compete in county leagues.</p>
			
			<h2>Cost of Membership</h2>
			<p>Each session carries a £3 attendance fee. After 3 sessions, new members are required to pay a £10 membership fee if they wish to continue. Thereafter, there is a £10 annual renewal.</p>
			<p>The Club has its own bank account and all monies are paid electronically into it.</p>
			<p>Any member is entitled to details of the Club accounting status at any time.</p>

			<h2>Club History and Organisation</h2>
			<p>We first started playing in 2017, coinciding with the opening of Fleet's new leisure centre which offers us modern 3G pitches and a friendly cafe. With membership numbers growing at a steady rate, we were soon able to assume formal club status with a constitution and a steering group to carry the load.</p>
			<p>The Club is affiliated to both the Walking Football Association and to Hampshire FA.</p>
